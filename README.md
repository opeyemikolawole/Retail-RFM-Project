# Retail-RFM-Project
Context:  This is a transactional data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.

Problem statement: It is a business critical requirement to understand the value derived from a customer. RFM is a method used for analyzing customer value. Perform customer segmentation using RFM analysis. The resulting segments can be ordered from most valuable (highest recency, frequency, and value) to least valuable (lowest recency, frequency, and value). Identifying the most valuable RFM segments can capitalize on chance relationships in the data used for this analysis.
